BlackDoctor,"BDO is the world's largest and most comprehensive online health resource specifically targeted to African Americans.

BDO understands that the uniqueness of Black culture - our heritage and our traditions - plays a role in our health. We also understand that there's a lot of mistrust of the healthcare system. That mistrust, combined with all the contradictory information in the media today, makes it difficult to truly feel in control of your health, and your life. 

But BDO gives you access to innovative new approaches to the health information you need in everyday language – so you can break through the disparities, gain control and live your life to its fullest. Guided by the leading physicians, BDO provides essential, but difficult to find, health resources for you and your family, including free referrals to the top Black physicians and health articles that focus on both culturally accurate content, as well as general health topics (yes, Blacks suffer from conditions like diabetes more, but they can break an arm, too).

The mission of Brighter Bites is to Create Communities of Health through Fresh Food, and it accomplishes this mission through a three-step program of Food Access, Food Literacy, and Food Engagement.

For 16 weeks during the school year and eight weeks during the summer, Brighter Bites provides 1) 30-35 pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables to each participating family 2) nutrition education consisting of handbooks, recipe cards, healthy tip sheets, and support for the implementation of a coordinated school health program, and 3) a fun food experience consisting of a healthy recipe tasting for everyone to try together when they pick up their produce at school dismissal.

For several years, Lisa Helfman and her family took part in a weekly fruit and vegetable co-op, and she watched her children's eating habits dramatically transform. So much so that her little boy turned down a piece of cake at a birthday party, craving instead the blueberries he'd grown fond of eating at home.

She was inspired to replicate this type of positive change in underserved communities. Lisa's vision was to bring a produce co-op to schools in these neighborhoods that included an educational component. She created a collaborative partnership between the Houston Food Bank and Dr. Shreela Sharma, an expert in nutrition and a professor of epidemiology at UTHealth School of Public Health, and they launched the program now known as Brighter Bites.

Since its inception, Brighter Bites has delivered millions of pounds of fresh produce and nutrition education to children and families in Houston, Dallas, and Austin, TX as well as New York City.

Colon Cancer Coalition,"The Colon Cancer Coalition started with one Get Your Rear in Gear race in 2005.  What started as one women's vision has since grown into a national coalition of people determined to end colorectal cancer deaths by increasing screening and educating others about the signs and symptoms of this treatable disease. We want all people to understand their risk factors and get the right screening at the right time.

Based in Minneapolis, Minn. the Colon Cancer Coalition is dedicated to encouraging on-time screening and raising awareness of colorectal cancer. The organization's signature Get Your Rear in Gear® run/walk and Tour de Tush® bike ride series are volunteer-led in communities throughout the United States. In 2017 the organization granted over $1 million dollars back to these local communities to build and sustain programs promoting early prevention and screening, as well as patient support services for this disease. Our grants fund colorectal cancer education, awareness, and prevention programs, colorectal cancer screening initiatives, colorectal cancer patient navigators, as well as support for colorectal cancer patients and their families.

By making the words colon, colorectal and colonoscopy a part of the everyday language, we believe we can overcome the fear and decrease deaths from this largely preventable cancer. For more information visit ColonCancerCoalition.org.

Hampton Fitness Products LTD,"Every club should be filled with equipment that's both beautiful and fun for members to use. But club owners are concerned with qualities beyond end-user satisfaction: They also need attractive, low-maintenance products that improve facility appearance and increase safety. These needs are what guides Hampton's product innovations. Hampton Fitness was founded on the idea that free weights aren't a ""necessary evil"" for fitness facilities, they're an essential part of the foundation of any gym. Hampton's founders had years of experience in iron and steel manufacturing before entering the fitness industry with the launch of Hampton Fitness in 1996. The company's dedicated team of fitness equipment experts is headquartered in Ventura, California, and Hampton free weight products are sold both directly and through a large network of independent dealers all over the country. It's this strict attention to detail that sets Hampton products apart. Hampton is committed to a tradition of innovation that can be seen in such product lines as its new Gel-Grip® Urethane Series, Jelly-Bell®, Gel-Bar®, Dura-Bell®, Gel-Pump-System® and Chrome Beauty-Grip. If a change doesn't advance the art of fitness cosmetically or functionally, then we don't add it to our line. But it's not only about the iron. Hampton knows that attractive, space-efficient storage displays can be as important to club owners as the weights themselves, so we spend almost as much time on the racking design as we do on what's going on the rack. We think the best innovations in free weights are still ahead of us. The more user-friendly we can make our equipment, the more people are going to want to go to the gym and get healthy. Hampton is proud to be a part of an industry that has the potential to help people not just live stronger, but better. It's A New Era and we are a RARE BREED. Forging a New Era of Blood, Sweat, and Change.

Orangetheory Fitness,"Orangetheory® Fitness is a scientifically designed, one-of-a-kind, group personal training workout broken into intervals of cardiovascular and strength training. Backed by the science of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), Orangetheory's heart-rate-monitored workouts are designed to get participants within the target-training zone of 84 percent to 91 percent of their heart rate, which stimulates metabolism and increases energy. Led by highly skilled coaches, each Orangetheory Fitness workout incorporates endurance, strength and power elements through a variety of equipment including treadmills, rowing machines, TRX® suspension training and free weights. The end result is more energy, visible toning and the 'Orange Effect'​ – where participants keep burning calories for up to 36 hours post-workout (the Orangetheory Fitness 'afterburn'​) for an average of 500+ total calories burned per every 60-minute workout.
